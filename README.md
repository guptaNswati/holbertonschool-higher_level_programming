# High Level Python Programming
This repository contains exercises to learn Python 3.4.3 at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). These exercises are designed to dive into Python from a beginners level to the advanced level.
## Styling and Specifications
All programs were written from Bash, using emacs.
### Compilation
All programs must run with pyton 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 14.04, and pass all style checks with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
All scripts should have execution permissions:
```
chmod u+x file
```
To Run the scripts:
```
python3 file.py
./file.sh
```
To check the styling:
```
pep8 file.py
```
### Directories
Each directory is named after a concept and contains ordered exercises from mandatory to advance level, and a README.md with a short description of its files.
